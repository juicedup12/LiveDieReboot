# LiveDieReboot
Entry for the 2022 GameDev.tv Game Jam
I wanted to do more with this game but I couldn't deal with all the bugs :(

my idea was to make a rube goldberg esque game with many different mechanics killing the player and bringing them back to life to solve more physics based puzzles

I wanted to have a turret section where you bounce off multiple obstacles to get to the goal

perhaps i'll revisit it



Controls, is just mouse and keyboard

wasd, space to move around, E to interact

I think level 2 is bugged, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, i don't understand unity's hit detection sometimes



Assets I used: 

unity starter assets package 3rd person controller
